# # Global historical temperature

# The US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA)
# maintains a large curated collection of weather data called the
# "Global Historical Climatology Network", or GHCN. The data we
# consider here are a subset of the GHCN, consisting of daily maximum
# and minimum temperatures, recorded at roughly 180 locations
# (stations) around the world.

# The daily maximum temperature ('tmax') is the highest temperature
# recorded at a specific location, over one 24-hour day.  The daily
# minimum temperature ('tmin') is the lowest temperature recorded
# at a specific location, over one 24-hour day.  Typically the
# highest temperature will occur in early afternoon, and the 
# lowest temperature will occur in early morning, but the dataset
# does not contain the exact time within a day at which the
# minimum and maximum temperatures were recorded.

# In addition to the temperature data, we also have the latitude,
# longitude, and elevation of each station.  

# These data can be used to address a number of important questions 
# relating to variation in weather and climate over time and in 
# different geographic locations.

# The data considered here are all quantitative.  Therefore we will be
# using methods for analyzing quantitative data, including measures of
# location and scale, scatterplots, boxplots, and scatterplot
# smoothing.

# These are the modules that we will be using:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels.api as sm
import os

# The following code is needed to make plots using timestamp data.

from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters
register_matplotlib_converters()

# Modify this string according to your section number (001 or 002):

f = "stats206s002f21"

# Next we read the data from a file.

base = "/scratch/%s_class_root/%s_class/shared_data/datasets" % (f, f)
df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(base, "ghcnd_gsn.csv.gz"))
print(df.shape)

# We need to convert the date variable to a timestamp, otherwise it
# will be in text format which is not as easy to work with.

df["date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["date"])

# It can be useful to insert logic checks such as the one below into
# your code.  The minimum temperature at one location for one day can
# never be greater than the maximum temperature for the same location
# on the same day.

assert(all(df.tmax >= df.tmin))

# The data records for different stations start and end at different
# times.  The average station has around 43 years of data.  The
# following plot shows us the beginning and end of the data record for
# each station

df["year"] = df["date"].dt.year
r = df.groupby("id")["year"].agg(["min", "max"])
plt.clf()
sns.scatterplot(x="min", y="max", ci=None, data=r)
plt.xlabel("First year", size=15)
plt.ylabel("Last year", size=15)

# The above plot shows us that most of the stations in our dataset
# have data going up to 2019 or 2020, although a few stop much
# earlier.  However the starting years vary substantially among the
# stations.  Note that this plot shows the date of the earliest and
# latest record for each station, but there is no guarantee that there
# is data for every single day between these two dates.

# Below we plot the locations of the stations.  Looking closely, you
# should be able to see that the stations fall on all seven
# continents.

plt.clf()
dx = df.loc[:, ["lon", "lat"]].drop_duplicates()
print(df.shape)
print(dx.shape)
sns.scatterplot(x="lon", y="lat", ci=None, data=dx)
plt.xlabel("Longitude", size=15)
plt.ylabel("Latitude", size=15)

# As an initial analysis, we take the stations that are at a similar
# latitude to Ann Arbor, Michigan (between 40 and 45 degrees north
# latitude).  We then stratify by month, and make boxplots showing the
# distributions of daily maximum temperatures within each month for
# these stations.

dx = df.loc[(df["lat"] >= 40) & (df["lat"] <= 45), :].copy()
print(dx["id"].unique().size)
dx["month"] = dx["date"].dt.month
sns.boxplot(x="month", y="tmax", data=dx)

# The boxplots above show the expected pattern of temperature
# variation throughout the year.  Specifically, the median and both
# the 25th and 75th percentiles exhibit lower temperatures in the
# winter and warmer temperatures in the summer.  While this is the
# most prominent feature of the above plot, it is also notable that
# the dispersion is greater in the winter than in the summer.  As an
# example of why this difference in dispersions ("heteroscedasticity")
# exists, consider Portland, Oregon and Ann Arbor, Michigan, which are
# at similar latitudes.  However Portland is near the Pacific Ocean
# which moderates its temerature, especially in winter.  While Ann
# Arbor typically has temperatures that remain below zero during
# January, Portland does not.  On the other hand, Portland and Ann
# Arbor have quite similar temperatures in the summer.

# By contrast to the above plot, if we select stations near the
# equator we get a very different result:

dx = df.loc[(df["lat"] >= -10) & (df["lat"] <= 10), :].copy()
print(dx["id"].unique().size)
dx["month"] = dx["date"].dt.month
sns.boxplot(x="month", y="tmax", data=dx)

# ## Annual temperature extremes

# In any given location, within each year the "temperature extremes"
# are the coldest and warmest temperatures that occur.  Next we
# compute these extremes.  Specifically, we calculate the minimum of
# the daily minimum temperatures, and the maximum of the daily maximum
# temperatures, over all days within each year at each station.  The
# result is a summarized dataset that contains two numbers for each
# station/year, corresponding to the coldest and warmest temperatures
# recorded at that location in one specific year.

r = df.groupby(["id", "year"]).aggregate({"tmax": np.max, "tmin": np.min, "lat": "first", "elev": "first"})
r = r.reset_index()
print(r.shape)

# Next we make a scatterplot showing the relationship between the
# maximum temperature extreme, at each location/year and the latitude
# of the location. Since there are many points, we plot with a small
# alpha (transparency) value to reduce overplotting.

sns.scatterplot(x="lat", y="tmax", ci=None, alpha=0.2, data=r)
plt.ylabel("tmax")
plt.grid(True)

# This plot becomes more informative if we include an estimate of the
# conditional mean trend, obtained using the lowess procedure:

r["tmax_smooth_lat"] = sm.nonparametric.lowess(r["tmax"], r["lat"], frac=0.2, return_sorted=False)
sns.scatterplot(x="lat", y="tmax", ci=None, alpha=0.2, data=r)
sns.lineplot(x="lat", y="tmax_smooth_lat", color="orange", ci=None, data=r)
plt.ylabel("tmax")
plt.grid(True)

# The pattern above reflects the fact that temperatures are warmest in
# the tropical bands just north and south of the equator, and decrease
# as we move toward either the north or the south pole.  Locations
# very close to the equator are slightly cooler than areas around 25
# degrees north or south of the equator.

# We can also consider the relationship between maximum temperature
# and elevation.

r["tmax_smooth_elev"] = sm.nonparametric.lowess(r["tmax"], r["elev"], return_sorted=False)
sns.scatterplot(x="elev", y="tmax", ci=None, alpha=0.2, data=r)
sns.lineplot(x="elev", y="tmax_smooth_elev", color="orange", ci=None, data=r)
plt.ylabel("tmax")
plt.grid(True)
plt.ylim(ymin=0)

# Here we see that the conditional mean of the annual maximum
# temperature is highest at moderate elevation, lower near zero
# elevation, which tends to be in coastal areas, and very low at high
# elevations.  Locations at very low elevation tend to be near the
# ocean, and as a result have somewhat moderated temperatures compared
# to more inland regions.

# ### Scatter and conditional dispersion

# The "scatter" in a scatterplot reflects the degree of conditional
# dispersion of the data values around the mean.  In the plot above
# that shows maximum temperature in relation to latitude, we see
# somewhat less dispersion near the equator.

# To investigate the conditional dispersion more formally, we can make
# a scatterplot of the absolute values of the residuals, and smooth it
# using lowess. To make residuals in a scatterplot, we take the
# variable that is plotted on the vertical axis, and subtract from it
# its fitted value obtained using lowess.  By then smoothing the
# absolute residuals, we are estimating the dispersion "local" to each
# latitude value.  We will limit the vertical axis range to more
# clearly see the shape of the smoothed curve.

r["resid"] = r["tmax"] - r["tmax_smooth_lat"]
r["absresid"] = np.abs(r["resid"])
r["absresid_smooth"] = sm.nonparametric.lowess(r["absresid"], r["lat"], frac=0.2, return_sorted=False)
plt.clf()
sns.scatterplot(x="lat", y="absresid", alpha=0.2, data=r)
sns.lineplot(x="lat", y="absresid_smooth", color="orange", ci=None, data=r)
plt.grid(True)
plt.ylim(0, 20)
plt.ylabel("Absolute residual")

# The above plot shows us that there are two regions of low
# dispersion, one near the equator, and one at around 40 degrees north
# latitude.  The dispersion in these locations is around half of the
# peak dispersion, which is at around 40 degrees south latitude.  Note
# that the minimum at 40N is hard to see from the scatterplot.  This
# is a situation where visual assessment is misleading due to
# overplotting.  When the density of points is very high, it is very
# difficult to visually judge the degree of dispersion.
#
# The dispersion minimum near the equator is easier to explain --
# there aren't many deserts or high mountains near the equator, so
# most equatorial locations reach maximum annual temperatures of
# around 35C. Moving away from the equator, there is more diversity in
# the topography, which leads to more variation in the climate.  The
# dispersion minimum near 40N is more difficult to explain.  It may be
# due to the selection of stations.  Note from the histogram below
# that the largest number of stations in our dataset occur between 40N
# and 60N, as this is where the greatest share of the Earth's landmass
# lies.

plt.clf()
sns.histplot(df.lat)

# ## Daily temperature range

# Now we turn to looking at the range of temperatures within a day,
# known as "diurnal temperature variation".  This range can be
# obtained by subtracting the daily minimum from the daily maximum
# temperature, both of which are variables in our dataset.  We can
# then explore whether the variation in the daily temperature range is
# related to the latitude, longitude, or elevation of the station.

df["range"] = df["tmax"] - df["tmin"]

# The behavior of temperature ranges differs by season.  To control
# for that effect, we select only data from June for this analysis.

dx = df.loc[df.date.dt.month==6, :].copy()

# The next plot shows us how the daily temperature range relates to
# the latitude at which a station is located.  Note that here we are
# running the lowess algorithm directly rather than letting Seaborn
# call it for us.  This gives us more control over how the algorithm
# runs.

plt.clf()
dx["range_smooth"] = sm.nonparametric.lowess(dx["range"], dx["lat"], return_sorted=False)
sns.scatterplot(x="lat", y="range", alpha=0.2, data=dx)
sns.lineplot(x="lat", y="range_smooth", color="orange", ci=None, data=dx)
plt.grid(True)

# The next plot shows us how the daily temperature range relates to
# the longitude at which a station is located.

plt.clf()
dx["range_smooth"] = sm.nonparametric.lowess(dx["range"], dx["lon"], return_sorted=False)
sns.scatterplot(x="lon", y="range", alpha=0.2, data=dx)
sns.lineplot(x="lon", y="range_smooth", color="orange", ci=None, data=dx)
plt.grid(True)

# This plot shows us how the daily temperature range relates to the
# elevation at which a station is located.

plt.clf()
dx["range_smooth"] = sm.nonparametric.lowess(dx["range"], dx["elev"], return_sorted=False)
sns.scatterplot(x="elev", y="range", alpha=0.2, data=dx)
sns.lineplot(x="elev", y="range_smooth", color="orange", ci=None, data=dx)
plt.grid(True)

# The three plots above show that the stations with high latitude or
# low elevation tend to have smaller within-day temperature ranges
# than the other stations during the month of June.  The low-elevation
# stations are near the ocean, and the ocean tends to moderate the
# temperature difference between night and day.  We also found that
# locations at higher (more northern) latitudes have somewhat less
# diurnal variation.  There are several reasons for this, including
# humidity, cloud cover, and the long duration of the solar day at
# high latitudes in summer.
